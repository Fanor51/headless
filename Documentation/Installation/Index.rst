Installation
==============

Follow the standard process of a TYPO3 installation (see :ref:`t3install:start`).
After TYPO3 is running, we can continue installing the headless extension:

#. **Install and activate the extension** with Composer `composer require friendsoftypo3/headless` (recommended),
   or using the extension manager with key `headless`.

#. **Create a new root page:** The page will provide our JSON API endpoint.

   .. figure:: ../Images/Installation/RootPage.png
      :alt: Root page for the API endpoint
      :class: with-shadow

#. **Create a new root template:** Add `headless` TypoScript template to "Include static (from extensions)". Save and view the page,
   content should be already displayed in JSON format, instead of HTML.

#. **Create a site configuration:** The site URL is needed as endpoint URL for the frontend.
   In TYPO3 v10 an autogenerated site configuration might exist which we can rename and configure to our preferences.

   .. important::

      We recommend to use an URL like `https://api.mydomain.org` as endpoint, because it might come to unexpected
      behaviours with URLs like `https://mydomain.org/api`. Probably this will be improved in a future version.
